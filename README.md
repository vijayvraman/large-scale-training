## 🏗️ Architecture Details

### Supervised Routing System

```
Dataset Expert Labels (4 categories)
    ↓
ExpertLabelEmbedding (learnable 4→8 mapping)
    ↓
Expert Preferences [batch, 8]
    ↓
KL Divergence Loss ← → Router Decisions [batch, seq, 8]
    ↓
Combined Loss = LM + Load Balancing + Routing Supervision
```

**Key Components:**

1. **ExpertLabelEmbedding**: Learnable linear projection from 4 categories to 8 expert preferences
2. **Routing Supervision Loss**: KL divergence between router and label-based preferences
3. **Soft Guidance**: Encourages but doesn't force specific routing decisions
4. **Learnable Mapping**: Model discovers optimal category-to-expert assignments

### Category to Expert Mapping

The system uses a **soft mapping** from 4 dataset categories to 8 model experts. This doesn't require a 1-to-1 correspondence:

**Dataset categories: 4**
- factual_lookup
- numerical_reasoning
- multi_hop_reasoning
- commonsense_reasoning

**Model experts: 8** (Mixtral 8x7B architecture)

**How the mapping works:**

1. **ExpertLabelEmbedding** creates learnable embeddings that map 4 categories → 8 experts
2. Multiple experts can specialize in the same category
3. Example learned specialization:
   - Experts 0, 1, 2 might handle factual_lookup
   - Experts 3, 4 might handle numerical_reasoning
   - Experts 5, 6 might handle multi_hop_reasoning
   - Expert 7 might handle commonsense_reasoning

**Benefits:**
- **Flexibility**: Multiple experts can be assigned to complex categories
- **Fine-grained specialization**: Different experts within a category can sub-specialize
- **Routing efficiency**: The model uses top_k=2 (routes to 2 experts per token), and the supervised loss guides it toward category-appropriate experts

### Expert Categories

| Category | Examples | Purpose |
|----------|----------|------------|
| `factual_lookup` | "Who won...", "What is..." | Direct fact retrieval |
| `numerical_reasoning` | "How many...", "What percentage..." | Numerical computation |
| `multi_hop_reasoning` | "Compare A and B", "Between X and Y" | Multi-step reasoning |
| `commonsense_reasoning` | "Why does...", "What causes..." | Common sense inference |

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### DeepSpeed ZeRO-2 with Expert Parallelism (8x B200 GPUs)

The configuration is optimized for 8x NVIDIA B200 GPUs (183GB each) with a hybrid approach combining **Data Parallelism** and **Expert Parallelism**:

```json
{
  "train_micro_batch_size_per_gpu": 1,
  "gradient_accumulation_steps": 8,
  "zero_optimization": {
    "stage": 2,
    "offload_optimizer": {
      "device": "cpu",
      "pin_memory": true
    },
    "overlap_comm": true,
    "reduce_bucket_size": 50000000.0,
    "allgather_bucket_size": 50000000.0
  },
  "bf16": {"enabled": true},
  "activation_checkpointing": {
    "partition_activations": true,
    "cpu_checkpointing": false
  },
  "moe": {
    "enabled": true,
    "num_experts": 8,
    "expert_capacity_factor": 1.0,
    "top_k": 2,
    "expert_parallel_size": 2
  }
}
```

**Key Optimizations for 8x B200 GPUs:**

1. **Hybrid Parallelism Strategy**
   - **Expert Parallel Size**: 2 (2-way expert parallelism)
   - **Data Parallel Degree**: 4 (8 GPUs ÷ 2 = 4-way data parallelism)
   - **Experts per GPU**: 4 (8 experts ÷ 2 expert parallel groups)
   - **Benefit**: Higher data parallelism for better throughput, balanced with expert distribution

2. **Batch Configuration**
   - **Micro batch size**: 1 per GPU (conservative for memory stability)
   - **Gradient accumulation**: 8 steps
   - **Effective global batch**: 64 (1 × 8 × 8 GPUs = 64)
   - **Sequence length**: 64 tokens (mini training), 512+ for full training
   - **Benefit**: Stable training with CPU optimizer offload preventing OOM

3. **Memory Optimization**
   - **Optimizer offload**: CPU with pinned memory (required)
   - **Reason**: Optimizer states consume ~43GB/GPU with EP=2, causing OOM without offload
   - **Benefit**: Moves ~43GB optimizer memory to CPU, reduces GPU usage from ~160GB to ~117GB

   - **Activation partitioning**: Enabled (sharded across GPUs)
   - **Reason**: Reduces activation memory by 50-75% per GPU
   - **Tradeoff**: Adds 5-15% communication overhead vs standard checkpointing
   - **Alternative**: CPU offloading of activations (2-10x slower, avoided in favor of partitioning)

4. **Communication Optimization**
   - **Bucket sizes**: 50MB (optimized for B200 NVLink/NVSwitch)
   - **Overlap communication**: Enabled for hiding latency
   - **Benefit**: Maximizes high-bandwidth interconnect utilization

**Parallelism Layout:**

### Alternative Configurations

For different GPU counts, adjust `expert_parallel_size` in `deepspeed_moe_config_stage2.json`:

| GPUs | Expert Parallel | Data Parallel | Experts/GPU | Notes |
|------|----------------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| 8 | 2 | 4 | 4 | **Current configuration** |
| 8 | 4 | 2 | 2 | Lower memory per GPU, more communication |
| 8 | 8 | 1 | 1 | Max expert parallelism, no data parallelism |
| 4 | 4 | 1 | 2 | All GPUs for expert parallelism |
| 4 | 2 | 2 | 4 | Balanced expert + data parallelism |
| 2 | 2 | 1 | 4 | Original H100 configuration |

### Memory Usage (8x B200 Configuration)

| Component | Total Size | Per GPU (ZeRO-2 + EP=2) |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Model params | ~86 GB | ~86 GB (not sharded by ZeRO-2) |
| Gradients | ~86 GB | ~21.5 GB (4-way DP sharded) |
| Optimizer | ~172 GB | **Offloaded to CPU (~43 GB/GPU)** |
| Activations (batch=1, seq=64) | ~32 GB | ~4 GB (partitioned 8-way) |
| **Total GPU** | - | **~111.5 GB / 183 GB** |
| **Total CPU** | - | **~43 GB (optimizer per GPU)** |

**Key Memory Features:**
- **CPU Optimizer Offload**: Required to prevent OOM - saves ~43 GB GPU per GPU by storing Adam states in CPU
- **Activation Partitioning**: Shards activations across 8 GPUs, reduces activation memory by ~87.5%
- **Short Sequences**: seq_len=64 for mini training minimizes activation memory
- **Memory Headroom**: ~71.5 GB free per GPU for safety margin
- With expert parallelism (EP=2), each GPU holds 4 of 8 experts; Top-2 routing activates 2 experts per forward pass

### ZeRO Stage 2 vs Stage 3

Two DeepSpeed configurations are provided:

**Stage 2 (deepspeed_moe_config_stage2.json)** - **Current configuration**
- Shards optimizer states and gradients across data parallel dimension (4-way)
- Offloads optimizer states to CPU (required to prevent OOM)
- Model parameters stay in GPU memory
- **Best for**: Mixtral-8x7B on B200 GPUs with CPU offload
- **Pros**: Stable training with manageable memory footprint
- **Memory**: ~111.5 GB/GPU with EP=2 + CPU offload

**Stage 3 (deepspeed_moe_config_stage3.json)** - For memory-constrained scenarios
- Shards model params, optimizer, and gradients across all GPUs
- Offloads optimizer and params to CPU when needed
- **Best for**: Lower-memory GPUs, larger batch sizes, or longer sequences
- **Pros**: Maximum memory efficiency (~40-50 GB/GPU)
- **Cons**: Significantly slower due to heavy CPU offloading and communication
- **Memory**: Much lower than Stage 2, but with substantial performance penalty

**Switching between stages:**

```bash
# Edit accelerate_config.yaml, line 4:
deepspeed_config_file: deepspeed_moe_config_stage2.json  # or stage3
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Out of Memory (OOM)

**Current Configuration (Optimized):**
The configuration has been tuned to prevent OOM on 8x B200 GPUs:
- Micro batch size: 1 (conservative for large models)
- CPU optimizer offload: Enabled (required - saves ~43 GB/GPU)
- Sequence length: 64 (in mini training), adjustable for full training

**If you still encounter OOM:**

**Solution 1:** Verify CPU offload is enabled
```bash
# Check deepspeed_moe_config_stage2.json
grep -A 3 "offload_optimizer" deepspeed_moe_config_stage2.json
# Should show: "device": "cpu"
```

**Solution 2:** Reduce sequence length further
```bash
bash run_training.sh --max-seq-length 64
```

**Solution 3:** Switch to ZeRO-3 (more aggressive offloading)
```bash
# Edit accelerate_config.yaml, line 4:
deepspeed_config_file: deepspeed_moe_config_stage3.json
```

**Solution 4:** Increase expert parallelism (reduces experts per GPU)
```json
// Edit deepspeed_moe_config_stage2.json
"moe": {
  "expert_parallel_size": 4  // Was 2, reduces to 2 experts per GPU (EP=4, DP=2)
}
```

### Training Too Slow

**Expected speed:**
- 8x B200 (EP=2, DP=4, CPU offload): ~1-2 it/s
- 2x H100 (EP=2, DP=1): ~0.5-1.0 it/s

**Note**: CPU optimizer offload adds overhead (~30-40% slower) but is required to prevent OOM

**If slower:**
- Check GPU utilization: `nvidia-smi`
- Verify all 8 GPUs are being used
- Check for I/O bottlenecks (slow disk)
- Verify NVLink/NVSwitch connectivity: `nvidia-smi topo -m`

### Router Collapse (Some Experts Unused)

**Symptoms:**
- Some experts receive <5% of tokens
- Routing loss plateaus high

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Increase load balancing (edit deepspeed_moe_config.json)
"router_aux_loss_coef": 0.02  # Default: 0.01

# Reduce routing supervision
bash run_training.sh --routing-weight 0.05

# Increase capacity factor (edit deepspeed_moe_config.json)
"expert_capacity_factor": 1.5  # Default: 1.25
```

### Model Download Issues

If Mixtral download fails:

```bash
# Pre-download model
huggingface-cli download mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1

# Or use local path
bash run_training.sh --model-id /path/to/local/mixtral
```

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Why Supervised Routing?

Standard MoE training uses learned routing without explicit guidance. Our approach adds soft supervision:

1. **Dataset labels** indicate question type (factual, numerical, etc.)
2. **Learnable embedding** maps 4 categories to 8 expert preferences
3. **KL divergence loss** guides (but doesn't force) routing decisions
4. **Model learns** optimal category-to-expert assignment during training

**Benefits:**
- Faster convergence to expert specialization
- More interpretable expert assignments
- Better handling of category-specific patterns
- Maintains flexibility of learned routing

### Load Balancing

Load balancing loss ensures all experts are utilized:

```python
# Mean gate probability per expert
me = mean(router_probs, dim=tokens)

# Mean token assignment per expert
ce = mean(expert_assignments, dim=tokens)

# Penalty for imbalance
load_balance_loss = sum(me * ce) * num_experts
```

Combined with routing supervision, this creates balanced expert specialization.

### Cosine Annealing Learning Rate Schedule

The training uses cosine annealing with warmup for the learning rate schedule:

```python
lr_scheduler = get_cosine_schedule_with_warmup(
    optimizer=optimizer,
    num_warmup_steps=warmup_steps,
    num_training_steps=total_training_steps,
)
```

**How it works:**

1. **Warmup Phase**: Learning rate increases linearly from 0 to the specified `--lr` value over the first warmup steps
2. **Cosine Decay**: After warmup, the learning rate follows a cosine curve, gradually decreasing to near-zero
3. **Smoother Convergence**: Unlike linear decay, cosine annealing stays at higher learning rates longer, then decays more smoothly

**Benefits:**
- Better convergence compared to constant or linear decay
- Helps escape local minima during training
- Reduces risk of overfitting toward the end of training
- More stable training for large models like Mixtral

**Configuration:**

The warmup steps default to 10% of total training steps but can be adjusted:

```bash
# Custom warmup (via code modification)
# Default: warmup_steps = total_steps // 10
```

The learning rate schedule is automatically saved and restored when resuming from checkpoints, ensuring training continuity.

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Configuration | Hardware | Training Time | Memory | Expert Utilization |
|---------------|----------|---------------|--------|-------------------|
| MPT-7B (no MoE) | 2x H100 | ~2-2.5 hrs/epoch | ~40 GB/GPU | N/A |
| Mixtral (no supervision) | 2x H100 | ~8-10 hrs/epoch | ~55 GB/GPU | Varied (60-90%) |
| Mixtral (supervised) | 2x H100 | ~8-10 hrs/epoch | ~55 GB/GPU | Balanced (>90%) |
| **Mixtral (supervised, EP=2)** | **8x B200** | **~2-3 hrs/epoch** | **~111 GB/GPU** | **Balanced (>90%)** |

**Key improvements with 8x B200 GPUs:**
- **3-4x faster training** due to 4-way data parallelism
- **CPU optimizer offload** required for stability (~43 GB offloaded per GPU)
- **Higher throughput** from optimized communication (50MB buckets)
- **71.5 GB free memory** per GPU for safety margin

Supervised routing doesn't add training time overhead but improves expert utilization.

## 🏆 Best Practices

1. **Start with mini training** to verify setup
2. **Monitor expert utilization** for router collapse
3. **Tune routing weight** (0.05-0.5) based on results
